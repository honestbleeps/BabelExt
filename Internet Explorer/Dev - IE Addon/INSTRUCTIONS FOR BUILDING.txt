IMPORTANT: For a trouble-free build, the following steps are important.

1. Go to the Start menu and find Visual Studio 2008.
2. Right-click and choose "Run as Administrator".
3. Find the SharingTime.sln file and load it.

During the build process, the ST.dll file will have been registered in the
Release directory. If you copy it to the C:\Program Files\SharingTime\core
directory, the registry will still cause the file in the Release directory
to be loaded. To fix this, perform the following steps after copying ST.dll
to the C:\Program Files\SharingTime\core directory:

1. Go to Start - Accessories.
2. Right-click on Command Prompt and choose "Run as Administrator".
3. Change to the C:\Program Files\SharingTime\core directory.
4. Run the following command > regsvr32 ST.dll
